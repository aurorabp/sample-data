# Aurora-BP Study Data

Here, you can access data related to the associated Aurora-BP Study publication: "[A Comparison of Wearable Tonometry, Photoplethysmography, and Electrocardiography for Cuffless Measurement of Blood Pressure in an Ambulatory Setting.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9721156)"

The publishing of these datasets as well as the characterization of multiple feature groups across a broad population and multiple settings are intended to aid future cardiovascular research. These datasets include de-identified participant information, as well as aligned and featurized sensor data. See publication for more information. Below are details describing the published dataset and access information.
